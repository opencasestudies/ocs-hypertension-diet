## Motivation


The link between hypertension and diet is well-established, with salt intake one of the most important risk factors for developing hypertension. Moving beyond the association of hypertension and salt intake, we focus here on other factors that might have an impact on having hypertension.

This case study will also introduce logistic regression and survey-weighted logistic regression, focusing on the difference between the two models. As we are using survey data, we show that survey-weighted logistic regression is a good choice of model in this setting.




## What is the Data

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey started in the 1970â€™s and became a continuous program starting in 1999. A large portion of the data is publicly available at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx. The R package nhanesA (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nhanesA/vignettes/Introducing_nhanesA.html) makes it relatively easy to explore the NHANES data for surveys conducted since 1999. Additionally, the linked mortality data are available for NHANES III (from XXXXX -- TED please insert year here) and later surveys at this site: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-linkage/mortality-public.htm, which is useful for exploring questions related to survival outcomes of the survey participants.

The New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES), modeled on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, is a population-based, cross-sectional study with data collected from a physical examination and laboratory tests, as well as a face-to-face interview and an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI).(cited from http://nychanes.org/data/). The data used in this case study is from NYC NHANES (a local version of NHANES). 



## Data Preprocessing

MAT: Ted, I'm not sure about the logic in installing the packages -- I'll include a question in the word doc/Slack channel
### Load packages
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
if(!require("nhanesA")){
  install.packages(c("nhanesA", "tidyverse", "knitr", "sas7bdat", "tableone", 'survey', "kableExtra", "multcomp", "GGally", "ggpubr", "Rmisc"))
}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(sas7bdat)
library(tableone)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(survey)
library(broom)
library(multcomp)
library(GGally)
library(ggpubr)
library(Rmisc)
```


### Read the Data from csv File


```{r}
dat <- read.sas7bdat('./data/dat.sas7bdat')
```

### Select the Variables that You're Interesed In

*MAT: can you include a link to the paper you are referring to or at least reference it?*

*MAT: I think you should add some details here of the variables you are considering: maybe a table with each variable name and a brief description of the different values?*

For the covariates of interest, we checked the related paper and selected 11 covariates that have a potential association with hypertension according to the authors. The variables can also be chosen by univariate analysis in the whole data set with adjusted family error rates. We discuss this process in our OCS [project on classification](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-hypertension-classification).

*MAT: Maybe link to the other case study here?*


MAT: could consider doing this using a tidyverse function like select or rename
```{r}
hypertension_DF <- data.frame(
id = dat$KEY,
age = dat$SPAGE,
race = dat$DMQ_14_1,
gender = dat$GENDER,
born = dat$US_BORN,
diet = dat$DBQ_1,
income = dat$INC20K,
diabetes = dat$DX_DBTS,
bmi = dat$BMI,
hypertension = dat$BPQ_2,
drink = dat$ALQ_1_UNIT,
smoking = dat$SMOKER3CAT,
surveyweight = dat$CAPI_WT
)
```

### Adjust the Data Type


After you get your data set, adjusting the type of the covariate is very important, and you should do before doing any analysis in R. Sometimes people forget to change the type of data, and usually, it will give you a totally wrong result.

For example, in ` lm()` and ` glm()`, the function will automatically make the factor to categorical data and if you didn't change the type of the data, you will have the wrong result where the categorical variables are treated as continous variables.

There are several ways that you can have a glance at your data. Plotting the data or using the `summary` or `str` functions are excellents way to understand your data at first sight.


The ` str()` function will return the name of the variables along with their type and some values. It helps you to check the levels and missing values in the categorical data. The `glimpse` function does something similar.

```{r}
## check the original data type
str(hypertension_DF)
```





```{r}
## find a charactor of the data for further adjustment
summary(hypertension_DF)
```




From the two figures above, we can tell that there are some categorical variables like race, gender, born place, diet, neighborhood incomes, income, diabetes, BMI, drink, and smoke.

So, the first step, we need to, instead of using the numeric class of it, change it to factors.

We can, of course, change it one by one. However, the reason that we plot the data and look at the summary of it first is that it can give us some information so that we can process the data easier.

A better way to change the type of data especially when you have lots of covariates is to set a threshold according to the character of the data. Here, we can see that the mean of the categorical data cannot exceed 5. So, we set 5 as the threshold and for any variable with mean smaller than 5, we set it to factor, else, we maintain its type.




```{r}
factorvars <- NULL
## if the mean value of the data is smaller than 4, 
## it means these data is very likely to be categorical data, adjust it to factor.
for (i in 2:length(hypertension_DF)) {
  hypertension_DF[hypertension_DF[,i] == 'NaN',i] <- NA
  if( mean(hypertension_DF[,i], na.rm = T) < 5 ){
    ## For NaN, change it to missing value first
    #hypertension_DF[hypertension_DF[,i] == 'NaN',i] <- NA
    hypertension_DF[,i] <- as.factor(hypertension_DF[,i])
    ## Record the categorical data
    factorvars[i] <- names(hypertension_DF)[i]
  }
}
## check the changed data type
str(hypertension_DF)
```

### Rename the Levels of the Factor

As the str function shows, we now have our categorical variable in position. However, it's kind of hard for us to tell what the different levels represent in categorical variables. So we can rename the level and make it easier to read and analyze later.



```{r}
hypertension_DF$race <- as.factor(hypertension_DF$race)
levels(hypertension_DF$race) <- c('White', 'Black/African American', 'Indian (American)/Alaska Native', 'Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander', 'Asian', 'Some Other Race')
levels(hypertension_DF$gender) <- c('Male', 'Female')
levels(hypertension_DF$born) <- c('US-born', 'Other')
levels(hypertension_DF$diet) <- c('Excellent', 'Very good', 'Good', 'Fair', 'Poor')
levels(hypertension_DF$income) <- c('Less than $20,000','$20,000 - $39,999','$40,000 - $59,999','$60,000 - $79,999','$80,000 - $99,999','$100,000 or more')
levels(hypertension_DF$diabetes) <- c('Diabetic dx', 'Diabetic but no dx', 'Not diabetic')
levels(hypertension_DF$hypertension) <- c('Yes', 'No')
levels(hypertension_DF$drink) <- c('Weekly', 'Monthly', 'Yearly')
levels(hypertension_DF$smoking) <- c('Weekly', 'Monthly', 'Yearly')
```


```{r, fig.height=7}
ggpairs(hypertension_DF[,-1])
```



### Check Normality of the Numeric Variables


After changing the dataset, we are now, having a clean dataset. To explore the data more, we need to do some analysis on the data and to check some other features of them.

One thing that we want to do first is to check the normality of your continuous data because we have to decide what test statistics to use. For example, we use the t-test to check the difference of the normal distribution and Wilcoxon test to check the difference of non-normal distribution.


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
for (i in names(hypertension_DF[,-ncol(hypertension_DF)])) {
  if( is.numeric(hypertension_DF[,i] ) ){
    qqnorm(hypertension_DF[,i], main = i)
    qqline(hypertension_DF[,i])
  }
}
```


Since the age and BMI are not normally distributed, we should use the non-parametric(Wilcoxon) method to test the differences.


## Survey Weighted Data


So what model can we use in our case?

+ binary outcomes

You might think of logistic regression. Yes, you're pretty close already. However, think of the nature of our dataset. It's a data obtained from survey, and there is an important point to consider for analysis of survey data.




### What is Survey Weighted Data

It possible and indeed often happens to a perfectly designed sampling plan ends up with too many samples in a category. For example, too many women and not enough men, or too many white and not enough other races or both. Data weighting make sense for this kind of data. If we want the data to reflect the whole population, instead of counting the weight of each data point as one, we weight the data so that the sample we have can better reflect the entire community.



### What is the Weight of Data


Assuming that you have 25 students (20 male and 5 female) in your class, and you want to talk with 5 of them to know their understanding of the biostatistics class. By sampling 5 students from the total 25 students, you might get 5 all female students or 4 female and 1 male in your sample. Do you expect this sample to represent the population? Of course not. That's why we have to weight the observation so that we can make the sample better represent the population. The way of calculating the weight is:



$$Weight = \frac{Proportion~in~population}{Proportion~in~sample}$$
$$Male~Weight = \frac{20/25}{1/25} = 20$$
$$Male~Weight = \frac{5/25}{4/25} = 1.25$$


When we have multiple strata on the data, it might be troublesome to calculate the weight. However, for most of the survey data, the weight is calculated and included in the dataset. In our case study, the weight is calculated and we can simply apply the weight in the survey-weighted logistic regression.


### What is Finite Population Correction Factor

$$FPC = (\frac{N-n}{N-1})^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
+ N = population size
+ n = sample size


The finite population correction (fpc) is used to reduce the variance when a substantial fraction of the total population of interest has been sampled. It may not be appropriate if the target of inference is the process generating the data rather than the statistics of a particular finite population.


The Finite Population Correction Factor (FPC) is used when you sample without replacement from more than 5% of a finite population. Itâ€™s needed because under these circumstances, the Central Limit Theorem doesnâ€™t hold and the standard error of the estimate (e.g. the mean or proportion) will be too big. In basic terms, the FPC captures the difference between sampling with replacement and sampling without replacement.


Most real-life surveys involve finite populations sampled without replacement. For example, you might perform a telephone survey of 10,000 people; once a person has been called, they wonâ€™t be called again. (https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/finite-population-correction-factor/)




```{r}
fpc <- ((5827719 - 1527)/(5827719-1))^0.5
fpc
```


### Fit the survey weighted logistic regression

There is a function ` svydesign()` in R package ` survey`. The function is used to specify a survey design. Some arguments that is useful in our analysis.

+ ids: Formula or data frame specifying cluster ids from largest level to smallest level, ~0 or ~1 is a formula for no clusters.

+ data: Data frame to look up variables in the formula arguments, or database table name

+ weights = Formula or vector specifying sampling weights as an alternative to ` prob`

+ fpc: Finite population correction


```{r}
hypertension <- hypertension_DF$hypertension
hypertension <- ifelse(hypertension == 'No',0,1)
hypertension_design <- svydesign(
  id = ~1,
  data = hypertension_DF[,-c(1,13)],
  weights = ~hypertension_DF$surveyweight,
  fpc = ~rep(fpc, nrow(hypertension_DF))
)


```




## Exploratory Data Analysis


### Survey Weighted Demographic table


The ` Createtableone` function from ` TableOne` package offers a survey-weighted version of demographic table. We can use the ` svyCreateTableOne` function output the demographic table for survey weighted data after the design was set up.






```{r, results='hide'}
svyCreateTableOne(data = hypertension_design, strata = 'hypertension', factorVars = factorvars) %>%
  print(nonnormal = c('age','BMI')) -> tblprint2
tblprint2
tblprint2[,4][c(2,3,10:12,18,25,29:31,35)] <- c('Wilcoxon', 'Chi-sq', 'Chi-sq', 'Chi-sq', 'Chi-sq', 'Chi-sq', 'Chi-sq', 'T-test', 'Chi-sq','Chi-sq', 'Chi-sq')
tblprint2[,1] == 'hypertension'
```


```{r}
kable(tblprint2 [-c(30,39),], "html", caption = "Stritified by hypertension", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling('responsive') %>%
  add_indent(c(5:9,13:17,19:24,26:28,31:33,35:37))
```








### Eorrbarplots, boxplots and residual plots



Before doing those plots, we need to fit the model with the survey weighted data using ` svyglm()` function from the ` suvery` package.

It's similary to fit a normal logistic regression, the only difference is that instead of using the orignal data set in the ` data` argument, you should input the object from the ` svydesign()` to the ` design` argument in the function


```{r}
hypertension_design$variables$hypertension <- ifelse(hypertension_design$variables$hypertension == 'No', yes = 0, no = 1)

fit1 <- svyglm(hypertension ~ diet, design = hypertension_design)


```


After fitting the model, we can use our wrapper functions to do the data visualization and get some summary table that might be useful



As a data analyst, you probably will encounter this situation, writing similar codes for printing a table or visualization of your data. It can be quite annoying, and wrapper function can help you better solve you the trouble.

You can write a function that as general as possible so that it can solve as more problems as you wish.

There is something that you can do:

+ write your function and test your function for multiple data set

+ save your function as an R file

+ get your function from the directory you used to save the R file

And then, your function will appear, you can also save multiple functions in an R file, after quoting that R file, you will gain access for all the functions in that file



```{r}
source("svyplot.R")
```

```{r}
svyplot(fit1, output = 'table')

```

The table shows the number of people, the odds, and the standard deviance of having hypertension for each level.

Based on the table above, we can visualize it with errorbarplot and boxplot

```{r}
svyplot(fit1, output = 'errorbar')


```




## Data analysis



#### ANOVA and PostHoc Analysis


We can use the glht function from the multicomp package to do the PostHoc analysis. There're several ways to address the K matrix also known as comparision matrix. The easiest way is use Tukey to do the pairedwise comparision.




```{r}
glht(fit1, linfct = mcp(diet = "Tukey")) %>%
  summary() -> tbl_ph

tbl_ph
```


The ` turkey` returns us the pairedwise comparision. However, what if we have too many levels or we want to focus on some of the specific comparisons? 

The other way is to design our matrix of linear functions (` linfct`) in the function

First, we can take a look on the ` linfct` in ` turkey`


```{r}
tbl_ph$linfct
```


$$K \times Y = C   \times X$$

The linfct is the K matrix before the Y, the intercept represent the level of Excellent in our case, and if we want to compare any level with excellent, we can just input 1 at that level, if we want to compare other two levels except the reference level, we can set 1 and -1 at those two levels.

let's try the K matrix campring reference level with all other levels

```{r}
K <- rbind(
  "Excellent - Good" = c(0,0,1,0,0),
  "Excellent - Fair" = c(0,0,0,1,0),
  "Excellent - Poor" = c(0,1,0,0,1)
)
```


```{r}
glht(fit1, linfct = mcp(diet = K)) %>%
  summary() -> tbl1
tbl1
```


Even more, we can design a matrix that compare the average of some values


```{r}
K <- rbind(

  "Ave. of Very good and good - Poor" = c(0,0.5,0.5,0,-1)
  )

```


```{r}
glht(fit1, linfct = mcp(diet = K)) %>%
  summary() -> tbl2
tbl2
```




## Summary of the results


```{r}
tbl1 %>%
  tidy() -> tbl1

tbl2 %>%
  tidy() -> tbl2


tbl <- rbind(tbl1, tbl2)[c(1,3,4,5,6)]
tbl$estimate <- exp(tbl$estimate)
names(tbl)[1] <- 'Comparision'
tbl$p.value[tbl$p.value < 0.001] <- '< 0.001'
tbl %>%
  kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling('responsive') %>%
  add_indent(c(1:4))
```



Reducing the quality of diet from excellent to good increase the odds of having hypertension by 1.06 ($P < 0.001$), reducing the quality of diet from excellent to fair increase the odds of having hypertension by 1.13 ($P < 0.001$), reducing the quality of diet from excellent to fair reduce the odds of having hypertension by 0.98 ($P < 0.001$) and reducing the quality of diet from average of very good and good to poor increase the odds of having hypertension by 0.97  ($P < 0.001$).

The reduction of diet quality to levels below the current diet quality increase the odds of having hypertension. The excpetion was made by changing from excellent to poor. However, using the average of the very good and good to poor to replace that result, the reduction of the diet quality, on the average, leads to increase in the odds of hypertension substantially.
